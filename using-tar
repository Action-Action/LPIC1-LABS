1. Create a directory in your home directory called 'exercises' and change to that directory.

    [root@tcox5 ~]# mkdir exercises && cd exercises

 

2. Create a tar archive, with verbose output during creation, called 'etc.tar' containing all files and directories from '/etc'. 

    [root@tcox5 exercises]# tar cvf etc.tar /etc

    tar: Removing leading `/' from member names

    /etc/

    /etc/fonts/

    /etc/fonts/conf.d/

    /etc/fonts/conf.d/10-scale-bitmap-fonts.conf

    /etc/fonts/conf.d/20-unhint-small-vera.conf

    /etc/fonts/conf.d/25-no-bitmap-fedora.conf

    /etc/fonts/conf.d/25-unhint-nonlatin.conf

    /etc/fonts/conf.d/30-metric-aliases.conf

    /etc/fonts/conf.d/30-urw-aliases.conf

    /etc/fonts/conf.d/40-nonlatin.conf

    (NOTE: Your output will be much larger, concatenated for space)

 

3. Display the contents of the file created in Step #2 above and pipe that output to a file called 'dirlist.txt'. Add that file to the archive created in Step #2 above. Display and look for that file within the archive.

    [root@tcox5 exercises]# tar tvf etc.tar > dirlist.txt

    [root@tcox5 exercises]# tar rvf etc.tar dirlist.txt

    dirlist.txt

    [root@tcox5 exercises]# tar tvf etc.tar | grep dirlist

    -rw-r--r-- root/root    120370 2015-09-29 19:16 dirlist.txt

 

4. Create a new directory called 'verify' inside the 'exercises' directory and change to that directory. Restore the contents of the archive file from Step #2 above here and make sure the new directory listing file created in Step #3 is present.

    [root@tcox5 exercises]# mkdir verify && cd verify

    [root@tcox5 verify]# tar xvf ../etc.tar

    etc/

    etc/fonts/

    etc/fonts/conf.d/

    etc/fonts/conf.d/10-scale-bitmap-fonts.conf

    etc/fonts/conf.d/20-unhint-small-vera.conf

    etc/fonts/conf.d/25-no-bitmap-fedora.conf

    etc/fonts/conf.d/25-unhint-nonlatin.conf

    etc/fonts/conf.d/30-metric-aliases.conf

    etc/fonts/conf.d/30-urw-aliases.conf

    etc/fonts/conf.d/40-nonlatin.conf

    etc/fonts/conf.d/45-latin.conf

    etc/fonts/conf.d/49-sansserif.conf

    (NOTE: Output concatenated for space)

    [root@tcox5 verify]# ll

    total 132

    -rw-r--r--.  1 root root 120370 Sep 29 19:16 dirlist.txt

    drwxr-xr-x. 98 root root   8192 Sep 29 18:43 etc

 

5. Delete the 'dirlist.txt' from this directory. Using the appropriate command, from the archive file created in Step #2, extract ONLY the 'dirlist.txt' from the archive to this directory.

    [root@tcox5 verify]# rm dirlist.txt

    rm: remove regular file ‘dirlist.txt’? y

    [root@tcox5 verify]# tar xvf ../etc.tar dirlist.txt

    dirlist.txt

    [root@tcox5 verify]# ll

    total 132

    -rw-r--r--.  1 root root 120370 Sep 29 19:16 dirlist.txt

    drwxr-xr-x. 98 root root   8192 Sep 29 18:43 etc
