Video One - apt-get Command Set

1. Find the 'sources.list' file on your distribution. Edit the file to contain a mirror to the UK repository:

deb http://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian wheezy-updates main contrib non-free
deb-src http://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian wheezy-updates main contrib non-free

Copy the sources.list file into your home directory, create a directory called 'coursethree' and place the file and all output files for this set of videos there.

    Make sure you are running the "debian" distribution in the server lab
    Add the source files to the end of the /etc/apt/sources.list file
    apt-get update
    mkdir ~/coursethree && cp /etc/apt/sources.list ~/coursethree

After executing a repository update, complete a upgrade to your existing packages.

    apt-get upgrade

2. Obtain a count of the packages that are needed to install a full apache2 install (package name 'apache2'). Simulate the full installation, with the appropriate switch for logging, pipe the output to ~/file.out and then place the file in the directory above.

    sudo apt-cache showpkg apache2 >> file.out
    sudo apt-get install -s apache2 >> file.out (output will show you the names and number of total packages and dependencies needing to be installed)

 

Video Two - DPKG Command Set

1. Obtain a package from any third party site (recommendations - dropbox) in .DEB format. Download using 'wget' from the command line.

2. Install the package you downloaded above, using dpkg with the appropriate command line options.  Resolve any missing dependencies using the associated 'apt-get' command, also pasting that command and resulting output in a file.

    dpkg -i nano_2.2.6-1+b1_amd64.deb
    apt-get -f upgrade (if there are dependency issues)
