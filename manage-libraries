Lab One

    Create a file called MyLab.out. Append the currently running processes (including process IDs) on the system to that file.
    Using the appropriate process command, obtain the number of running processes on the system and append that value to your file created above.
    Display the top command on your terminal but add the appropriate command parameter that will cause it to update 10 times and then exit.

 

ps aux > MyLab.out
ps aux | wc -l >> MyLab.out
top -n 10

Lab Two

    Create a directory (in your home directory) called mylibrary. Change the rights on that new directory so that everyone has read and execute access
    Add that directory to the system wide library path /etc/ld.so.conf and save the file
    Execute the command that will cause the system library path to update, now containing your new directory in its search path
    Append the contents of your new ld.so.conf file to the MyLab.out file created in Lab One
    Append the environment variable for your user called LD_LIBRARY_PATH to that same file
    Finally, append the system type, kernel version, hostname and Linux distribution type to the file above using the appropriate command and parameter(s)

cd ~ && mkdir mylibrary && chmod 755 mylibrary -R
sudo vi /etc/ld.so.conf (add line "/home/username/mylibrary" and save/exit)
sudo ldconfig
sudo cat /etc/ld.so.conf >> MyLab.out
echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH >> MyLab.out
uname -a >> MyLab.out
