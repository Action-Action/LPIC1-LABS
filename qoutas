1. Install the linux-image-extra-virtual package to enable quota kernel requirements, if you are usoing a lab or a virtual machine.

sudo apt-get install linux-image-extra-virtual

2. Install the quota package and the quotatool package

sudo apt-get install quota quotatool

 

3. Edit your fstab file to enable quotas on your root filesystem.

sudo vim /etc/fstab

 

    LABEL=cloudimg-rootfs   /        ext4   defaults,discard,usrquota,grpquota        0 0

4. Remount your root partition.

sudo mount -o remount /

5. Build the quota database.

sudo quotacheck -avugm

    quotacheck: Your kernel probably supports journaled quota but you are not using it. Consider switching to journaled quota to avoid running quotacheck after an unclean shutdown.

    quotacheck: Scanning /dev/disk/by-uuid/a09befc1-cf11-45ac-b1f4-52736ff06125 [/] done

    quotacheck: Cannot stat old user quota file //aquota.user: No such file or directory. Usage will not be subtracted.

    quotacheck: Cannot stat old group quota file //aquota.group: No such file or directory. Usage will not be subtracted.

    quotacheck: Cannot stat old user quota file //aquota.user: No such file or directory. Usage will not be subtracted.

    quotacheck: Cannot stat old group quota file //aquota.group: No such file or directory. Usage will not be subtracted.

    quotacheck: Checked 17976 directories and 140172 files

    quotacheck: Old file not found.

     

    quotacheck: Old file not found.

6. Display all existing user quotas for all filesystems and log the output to '/home/user/log.out'.

sudo repquota -a >> /home/user/log.out

7. Using the appropriate command, edit/create the quota file that use to limit their disk usage to 500k.

sudo edquota user

    Disk quotas for user user (uid 1001):

      Filesystem                   blocks       soft       hard     inodes     soft     hard

      /dev/disk/by-uuid/a09befc1-cf11-45ac-b1f4-52736ff06125       1192          0      500        53        0        0

     

8. Using the report quota command, list the new quota for that user as applied, and log the output to '/home/user/log.out'.

sudo repquota -s / >> /home/user/log.out
