1. Create and launch a CentOS distribution image in your server lab section.

2. Download the Lynx RPM using yumdownloader to root's home directory.

[root@localhost]# yumdownloader lynx

3. Determine if the package already exists on the system.

[root@localhost]# rpm -q lynx (if exists, will show somethign like; lynx-2.8.6-27.el6.x86_64)

4. Install the package on the system using RPM and the required flags.

[root@localhost]# rpm -i lynx-2.xxx.rpm

5. Use RPM to list all the files inside of the RPM package. 

[root@localhost]#  rpm -qpl lynx-2.xxx.rpm

6. Remove the package from the system.

[root@localhost]#  rpm -e lynx-2.xxx.rpm

7. Attempt the same install using 'yum' rather than 'rpm'.

[root@localhost]#  yum install lynx

8. Remove the package using yum.

[root@localhost]#  yum remove lynx (when you remove a package it is considered "erasing" you can also use "yum erase lynx" to remove the package)
