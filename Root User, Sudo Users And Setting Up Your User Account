1. Once logged into your system as a regular user, execute the command that will allow you to log into the root account.

 

    su -
    Password:
    Last login: Wed Sep 16 14:17:13 UTC 2015 on pts/0

 

2. As the root user, create a user called testuser. Be sure that the home directory of /home/testuser is created during user creation. Follow up by setting a password for this account.

 

    adduser -d /home/testuser -m testuser
    ls -al /home

    total 8
    drwxr-xr-x.  4 root     root       32 Sep 16 14:29 .
    drwxr-xr-x. 17 root     root     4096 Aug  6 19:28 ..
    drwx------.  2 testuser testuser   59 Sep 16 14:29 testuser
    drwx------. 11 user     user     4096 Sep 16 14:27 user

    passwd testuser

    Changing password for user testuser.
    New password:
    Retype new password:
    passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.

 

3. Exit the root account, run the command to log in as the newly created user. Using the sudo command, attempt to edit the /etc/sudoers file and note the results.

 

    su - testuser

    Password:

    sudo visudo /etc/sudoers

    We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
    Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things: 

        #1) Respect the privacy of others.
        #2) Think before you type.
        #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

    [sudo] password for testuser:

    testuser is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.

 

4. Execute the command that will allow you to log back into the root account. Once root, edit the /etc/sudoers file. Be sure that any member of the wheel group is granted sudo privileges. Save and exit the file.

 

    su -

    Password:
    Last login: Wed Sep 16 14:27:33 UTC 2015 on pts/0

    visudo

    visudo: /etc/sudoers.tmp unchanged

    cat /etc/sudoers | grep wheel

    ## Allows people in group wheel to run all commands
    %wheel  ALL=(ALL)       ALL
    # %wheel        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL

 

5. Add the testuser to the wheel group in the appropriate file. Exit the root user. Log back into the system as the testuser user. Again, attempt to edit the /etc/sudoers file using the sudo command and note the results.

 

    vim /etc/group
    cat /etc/group | grep wheel

    wheel:x:10:centos,testuser

    exit

    sudo visudo

    [sudo] password for testuser:
    visudo: /etc/sudoers.tmp unchanged
