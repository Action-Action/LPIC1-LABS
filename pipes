    cat /etc/passwd > myfile.txt
    cut -f1 -d: myfile.txt
    cat myfile.txt | wc -l
    cat myfile.txt |wc -w
    split -b 256 myfile.txt
    diff xaa xab

    Replace all instances of "root" in myfile.txt with "linuxroot" using sed the stream editor.
    Using grep for all for all words that start with an r have two wild card characters following and end with t.

    cat << stop - enter in any command three times then enter stop.
    sed 's/root/linuxroot/g' myfile.txt (s is for replace and g means every occurrence [globally])
