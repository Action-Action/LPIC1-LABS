1. View system services and jobs that are managed by upstart 

root@hostname: $ initctl list

Alternatively you could view the conf files in /etc/init which is the new location for upstart jobs replacing the old location /etc/init.d/. However, for backwards compatibility /etc/init.d is still support with upstart.
 
2. SSH is a job now managed by upstart in Ubuntu 14. Using Upstart restart the SSH service
 

root@hostname: $ restart ssh

3. Using the service command also restart the SSH service

root@hostname: $ service ssh restart

4. Create a new job that uses the logger command to create an entry into the /var/log/syslog log file stating the date and time the entry was run. The job should start when the system enters runlevel 4 and only runlevel4. you can use the /etc/init/cron.conf file as a starting template.Be sure to use the script stanza instead of the exec stanza. Name the configuration file 'logger.conf'

root@hostname: $ cd /etc/init
root@hostname: $ cp cron.conf logger.conf //(note the name of the conf file is fine whatever you had it as long as it ends in .conf)

[logger.conf]
description	"Logger service"
start on runlevel [4]
expect fork

respawn
script
logger -f /var/log/syslog "Hello world! $(date)"
end script
[end logger.conf file]

root@hostname: $ init-checkconf logger.conf

root@hostname: $ initctl list | grep logger

5. Get the default runlevel on the system

root@hostname: $ runlevel
N 2

6. Test that the job is working by instructing your system to move into runlevel 4

root@hostname: $ telinit 4
root@hostname: $ status logger (note that once you add a job to the /etc/init/ directory you can control it with restart/stop/status/start as well

7. Change back to your default runlevel on the system

root@hostname: $ telinit 2

8. View the SysLog file to verify the date has been entered with your message in the syslog

root@hostname: $ cat /var/log/syslog | grep "hello"

9. Change the logger.conf file so that the service starts in all the same run levels as the cron.conf job

[logger.conf]
description	"Logger service"
start runlevel [2345]
stop runlevel [!2345]

expect fork
respawn

script
 logger -f /var/log/syslog "Hello world! $(date)"
end script[end logger.conf file]
